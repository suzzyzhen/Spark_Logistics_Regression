Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis in statistics used for prediction of outcome of a categorical dependent variable from a set of predictor or independent variables. In logistic regression the dependent variable is always binary. Logistic regression is mainly used to for prediction and also calculating the probability of success.
In this part, we are going to use Logistic Regression to to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk. We use the Framingham Heart dataset (link) for the study.
